    "    I don't think that introspection would be a very good guide for modeling human cognitive processes. Introspection is internally-based, meaning that it gets its information from inside itself, which doesn't really work for an artificial intelligence, given that it requires information from outside the brain to learn from in the first place.\n",
    "    Introspection also inherently involves self-consciousness, which isn't something an artificial intelligence is capable of. Introspection also focuses on thoughts and feelings, which requires the capacity for emotions, which artificial intelligence lacks. Altogether, artificial intelligence lacks the self-awareness that is the basis of introspection, and that is very possibly a good thing, since a truly self-aware artificial intelligence would be rather concerning."

    "The following code implements a course-scheduling CSP. As we discussed in class, the courses to be scheduled are the variables, the domains are represented in a dictionary in which the keys are the courses and the values are lists of tuples containing the possible combinations of professor, classroom, and class time. Every class is a neighbor of every other class. The constraint function checks if there are any conflicts between professors and times or between times and rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement this scheduler CSP, I wrote 3 new methods: the first generates all the possible combinations of the given classrooms and class times, which the second method uses to generate the domains dictionary. The third generates a dictionary specifying the neighbors of each course, which are used to evaluate the constraints using the schedule_constraint method. The third new method I added generates the neighbors non-reflexively, since it would be redundant to compare, for instance, cs108 to cs112 if you had already compared cs112 to cs108. I chose this way of formulating/implementing the problem because it fit with what we talked about in class, and it was the way that things made the most clear sense to me."
