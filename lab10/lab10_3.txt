Exercise 10.3:

a.) Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
	The confusion matrix shows which classes were misclassified as other classes - in this case, it shows which digits get confused for each other.

b.) Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.
	The Keras example given in class is approximately twenty miles shorter, and looks like something I could maybe actually understand without my head exploding.
	(Note: I donâ€™t have any improvements to report here)

c.) Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
	The visualizations for 10 steps have more color diversity and is patterned a bit like a static-y TV, whereas the visualizations for 1000 steps seem to be depicting at least some vague shapes.
