Exercise 10.1:

a.) Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
		I would probably rather use Keras since it’s more simple (because it’s a high level API).

b.) Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.
	Task 1:
		learning_rate=0.18,
		steps=500,
		batch_size=10,
		hidden_units=[10, 2]
	Final RMSE (on training data):   116.26
	Final RMSE (on validation data): 115.33

	(Note: this was the best result I got after quite a lot of experimenting, so I finally just went with it even though it technically didn’t reach the goal of below 110)

	Task 2:
		Final RMSE (on test data): 108.74
