## DCGs in Prolog
#### *with a DCG for validating measures in various time signatures*

### Project Vision:
The purpose of this project was to learn about DCGs in Prolog and apply it to a new example domain (e.g. time signatures in music).

### Modules:
`lpn7exercises.pl` – my answers to the exercises found in [Ch.7 of Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse30)

`lpn7practical.pl` – my answers to the exercises found in the [Practical Session of LPN! Ch.7](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse31)

`musicDCG.pl` – DCG for validating measures in various time signatures

`proposal.ipynb` – original project proposal statements

`report.ipynb` – final written report about the project

`ShowcasePresentation.pdf` – a short powerpoint used to help demonstrate the project during the final showcase

`updates.ipynb` – a brief description of the changes made since the project walkthrough

### Running the Code:
My method of choice for running the code for this project is by copy/pasting the contents of `musicDCG.pl` into [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).
