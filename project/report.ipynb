In particular, the goal of this project was to learn about Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) in Prolog and then apply that to a musical domain by implementing my own DCG for checking whether or not a given list of note types constitutes a valid measure in the given time signature.\n\n## Background\nThis being a Prolog project, the main technology used is, of course, Prolog, specifically the SWI-Prolog implementation. Prolog is a declarative programming language based on first-order logic and was originally created to be of use in natural language processing. A Prolog knowledge base consists of logical rules and facts by which queries can be evaluated. More information about SWI-Prolog can be found at [their website](http://www.swi-prolog.org/features.html).\n\nAnother important resource for this project was Learn Prolog Now! by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz, which is an introductory-level guide for learning Prolog and is available both in book form and [online for free](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype\u003dhtml\u0026pageid\u003dlpn-html). LPN! is the main source of my knowledge of Prolog, and this project is based on its seventh chapter: Definite Clause Grammars. DCGs are basically a nicer way to write context-free grammars in Prolog. As chapter 7.1 discusses, it’s not too difficult to come up with Prolog statements to represent a context-free grammar using append/3, but that is a horribly inefficient method. As a more efficient alternative, another approach uses difference lists, thus representing information as two lists instead of one. The first list (the input list) contains the symbols to be fed into the program, and the second list (the output list) contains the symbols that should be left behind after the program chews through the input list. So, if the program can chomp through the input list without leaving anything behind (i.e. the output list is empty), that means that the input list represents a valid sentence in that grammar. Using a variable in place of the input list in a query will generate the valid sentences in the grammar. What DCGs provide, then, is a less icky syntax for writing the rules of the grammar, which will be translated into regular Prolog statements under the hood. Thus, we can write a rule in the following format: `vp --\u003e v,np.` and it will automatically be translated into `vp(A, B) :- v(A, C), np(C, B).`\n\nAnother helpful tool that I used for this project was [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/), which is an online IDE for Prolog. SWISH provides several nifty features such as basic syntax highlighting, being able to look at the knowledge base, the queries, and the results of previous queries, and the output results are formatted nicely.\n\n## Implementation\nThe first step I took in implementing my time signature DCG was to draw out the grammar rules in regular musical notation. Since pitch is not relevant to time signature and would just add unnecessary complexity to the system, I only considered note types/rhythm in my implementation. Also, in order to stay within the scope of this project, the note types included are limited to whole notes, half notes and dotted half notes, quarter notes and dotted quarter notes, eighth notes and dotted eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and the corresponding rests. The system of notation I used to represent the types of music notes consists of the first letter(s) of the note type (for instance, w for whole notes, dh for dotted half notes, and so on), along with an r to designate rests (for instance, dqr for a dotted quarter rest). The time signatures included in my implementation are four-four, three-four, two-four, two-two (cut time), six-eight, and nine-eight. Some examples are included in `ShowcasePresentation.pdf`.\n\n## Results\nI was able to incorporate a fairly wide range of time signatures and note types into my implementation, and my thorough testing leads me to be confident that my DCG is sound, meaning that it will not accept any invalid measures. It may not be entirely complete, however: because I did not include doubly-dotted note types, there are a few syncopated rhythms that it will not recognize as valid measures, even though they really are.\n\n## Implications\nThe social and ethical implications of this project and the technologies it uses don’t seem to be overly abundant. With all automation comes the potential to replace a human worker, but as far as I know, there is no such thing as a job in which a human is employed to validate measures of various time signatures, so this project seems quite safe on that front, at least. On its own, this project probably wouldn’t be overly useful, really, but it could perhaps be incorporated into a larger, more complex system of music notation in order to keep the system from allowing any invalid measures.\n\n"
