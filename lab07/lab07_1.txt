Exercise 7.1:

a.) Submit your solutions to exercises 1–2.
	Exercise 1:
		cities['Exercise 1'] = cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San')) & cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda area: area > 50)
		cities

	Exercise 2:
		cities.reindex([8, 1, 4, 0, 2])
		
		Adding “missing” indices is allowed because it makes it easier to use an external list to reindex because you don’t have to sanitize the input.

b.) Why would one use Pandas rather than the standard data manipulation features provided by NumPy?
		Pandas Series can be used as arguments to most NumPy functions. Pandas also includes nifty graphing functionality.

c.) Under what circumstances would it be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame?
		It could be useful to reorder a Pandas DataFrame if, for instance, you wanted to sort the rows by a certain column. It would also be useful if you wanted to randomize the order for any reason.
