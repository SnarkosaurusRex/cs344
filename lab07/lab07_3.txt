Exercise 7.3:

a.) Submit solutions to tasks 1–3.
	Task 1:
		california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"]/california_housing_dataframe["population"]

		calibration_data = train_model(
		    learning_rate=0.04,
		    steps=500,
		    batch_size=5,
		    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
		)
		Final RMSE (on training data): 130.62

	Task 2:
		plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
		plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
		plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

	Task 3:
		california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"]).apply(lambda x: min(x, 5))
​
b.) What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?
		They allow you to consider factors computed from other input features, such as population density.

c.) What are outliers and what is typically done with them?
		Outliers are values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data. They are typically set to some reasonable minimum or maximum value.
